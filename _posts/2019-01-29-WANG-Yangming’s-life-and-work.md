This essay is inspired by China’s Ming dynasty’s philosopher and strategist, Wang Yangming’s life, work and achievement in ethical philosophy and philosophy of mind in the 15th century. His work will be presented in three theories that generalized his ideas in the study of mind.

Wang Yangming is showed as a maverick person when he was 11 years old. He asked his teacher about the most important thing of a man’s life. His teacher said that imperial examinations and securing an official position are the most important things because they are the most accessible ways to maintain one’s social status. However, Wang Yangming disagreed and said the most important thing for a man should be being a sage, with a cultivation of morality.

Around 45 years later, it is recorded in the chronicle that on Wang Yangming’s deathbed, his disciple asked about the last words. He smiled and said “My mind is frank and forthright. Then nothing to say.” After a while, he closed his eyes and passed away. (Yangming, 2015)

As a leading figure in the study of mind, Wang Yangming’s statement has been usually demonstrated in Chinese high school History textbook like this: “Before you look at this flower, your mind and this flower are both in silence. When you look at this flower, your mind and the color of this flower become bright together. Then you see this flower is not outside your mind.” (Yangming, 2008) However, his statement has been universally misunderstood as denying the existence of the flower when somebody does not look at it, which also as denying the existence of the reality. In fact, its interpretation has nothing to do with whether the reality is fundamentally mental or the existence of external objects. Here he does not emphasize the existence of the flower, but rather on the influence of the flower as an external object on the mind. “Your mind and the color of the flower become bright together” means that the mind builds a connection with the flower since you sensed the flower. Whether it evokes the aesthetics, or value determination or other ability in mind, it is undeniable that the mind has been influenced because of the connection between the external object and the mind. The above interpretations and insights behind this statement lead to Wang Yangming’s first theory.

His first theory is that mind as intuitive knowledge. First, some definitions should be clarified. The mind is specified as the entity dominated by the sentience of conscience, an ability to distinguish good from evil and right from wrong. The intuitive knowledge is specified as the knowledge that explains people’s behaviors. Mind as intuitive knowledge does not mean they follow the principle of identity, but rather they are connected and the latter can be explained by the former. For example, if a person is nice and friendly to others. Then the intuitive knowledge is that the person believes being nice is good, which explains the behavior. Wang Yangming puts an emphasis on the mind (the conscience) instead of the intuitive knowledge (what they believe in one specific behavior). He thinks that a person with a good conscience in mind does many good things, we don’t have to figure out each intuitive knowledge that explains each behavior since the knowledge can all be explained by the good conscience in mind. Therefore, Wang Yangming thinks that all different pieces of intuitive knowledge are derived to be the same thing in mind for a person with a good conscience.

Wang Yangming’s first theory seems not remote to ancient Chinese since similar statements on the significance of practice on the mind and getting rid of the influence of external objects appear not only in Classics of ancient Chinese literature but also in proses of philosophers and poets in different dynasties over 1500 years. The concept of mind is considered appeared for the first time in <Book of Documents>, one of Classics of ancient Chinese literature. It introduced that the mind as principles including the moral judgment, values, and so on in “Mind of people is quirky and changeable. Mind with a good conscience is delicate and invisible. Gaining a mind with good conscience requires concentration, refinement, with no bias or too many changes.” (Guoxuan, 2006) Tao Yuanming, one of the greatest poets of the Six dynasties period also described his struggle of mind being a slave of his body in “Myself have made my soul serf to my body, why have vain regrets and mourn alone?” in <Ah, Homeward Bound I Go!>.  (Tao Yuanming, 2015) It is a trend to practice one’s mind as an entity that is independent of external objects throughout Chinese history. In Song Dynasty, Lu Jiuyuan, a philosopher who founded the study of the universal mind had famous words “The universe as my mind, and my mind as the universe.” (Xiangshan, 1992) The mind is defined as the essence that makes a human be a human, rather than animals or plants. It emphasized that the definition of mind as principles illustrated above and its insight into the relationship between mind and external object had a great impact on Wang Yangming’s following study of mind.

The second theory is extending good conscience to keep mind as it originally is, without evil intentions. Everybody’s mind is with a good conscience by birth. Nevertheless, as people grow up, so do their evil intentions. In this case, the mind has no longer good conscience, as the sunlight covered by clouds in the sky. To keep a good conscience in mind, people are encouraged to do some work such as being sincere, restraining evil thoughts, self-discipline while alone, studying extensively, enquiring accurately, reflecting carefully, practicing earnestly and likewise.

Before Wang Yangming formulated the second theory, extending good conscience, he used to practice the leading figure of the School of Principle, Zhu Xi’s theory, the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge. To Zhu Xi, the investigation involves paying attention to everything in both affairs and objects because moral principles in affairs are fundamentally the same as the physical laws in objects, and they are quite inexhaustible. He formulated the theory by interpreting “Expanding good conscience to people all over the world first requires practicing good governance; practicing good governance requires regulating the family; regulating the family requires self-cultivation of morality; self-cultivation of morality requires mind rectification; mind rectification requires sincerity in intention; sincerity in intention requires an extension of knowledge; extension of knowledge requires an investigation of things” in the first chapter in <Great Learning> (Guoxuan, 2006) which is one of the "Four Books" in Confucianism. Inspired by Zhu Xi’s theory, Wang Yangming practiced investigating bamboos for seven days and nights and tried to extend any knowledge from them. However, he nevertheless investigated nothing but caught a bad cold. It was when Wang Yangming began to doubt Zhu Xi’s theory. He no longer agreed that self-cultivation of morality requires investigating the physical laws or moral principles in everything, but requires the fundamental morality in mind. It will miss the point when concentrating on investigating the physical laws alone. A few years from then, Wang Yangming formulated and modified his own theories in ethical philosophy and philosophy of mind.

Because Wang Yangming’s theories involve in deterring people from evil intentions, they are frequently compared with theories in Buddhism. However, they have some essential difference that needs to be clarified. Wang Yangming thinks that when people have a good conscience in mind, they will have feelings including satisfaction, pleasure, and so on. The feelings are composed of nothing but happiness, anger, sorrow, fear, love, disgust, and desire, which are totally deterred in Buddhism. That is, Wang Yangming ensures the reasonability of the existence of the seven components of feelings.

The third theory is the unity of moral sentience and action. In moral activities, the moral sentience is specified to initiate one’s action, and the action is the realization of the moral sentience. So, moral sentience and action can be regarded as two aspects of one whole thing.
A person with a good conscience is not enough, it should be combined with proper behaviors. It is when proper actions are traced back to good conscience in mind that the person can genuinely extend and practice good conscience.

As is often been noted, Wang Yangming’s theories concentrate too much on the cultivation of morality and seem to ignore the development of science. However, from the third theory, the unity of moral sentience and action leads us a way that good conscience can drive the scientific investigation when people are driven by their subjective sentience to gain knowledge and fulfill self-determination and self-realization.

The above three theories generalized Wang Yangming’s main ideas in ethical philosophy, consisting of mind as intuitive knowledge, extending good conscience and the unity of knowledge and action. Nowadays, his theories in the study of mind are still having a great influence on the people of future generations.
