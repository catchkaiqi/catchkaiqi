I used the LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) cells from Keras to help implement a Shakespeare poem generator.
The following figure shows the operations of an LSTM-cell.

There is a trained model for ~1000 epochs on a collection of Shakespearian poems called "The Sonnets". After applying the model, we can write the beginning of our poem, then the generator will complete it.

For example, 
The input is: Why
Here is the poem: 

Why thou lerst have thee.

The input is: What a day!

Here is the poem:
